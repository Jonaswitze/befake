## a bereal viewer

client for bereal.com </br>
want to stalk your friends, family, or ex without posting your own bereal? 
toofake gives the ability to view bereals and post custom bereals without ever having to click on that annoying notification

### work in progress
- commenting still needed
- posting still needed

## how to run locally

- you need the geopy and humanfriendly libraries installed for python
- create a .env file in the server directory and add a google maps api key labeled GAPI='your_key'
- start flask server on api.py
- npm start in client directory
